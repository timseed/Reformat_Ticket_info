#Juliets Problem

In her day to day job Juliet gets travel agent booking info - and has to formard these on to other people, however it seems that there are different manners which this info is sent - and the people who read her communications do not understand them.

So lets standardise the output....

Plus make it a little easier for her to send out the reports.


#Requirements

There should be an accurate file called requirements.txt so a typical pip command of

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Should take care of all the Modules that you require (there are only 2)


#Running

Again nice and simple

```python
#Setup your Virtual Python Env (I am assuming you are using one)
python jt.py
```

At this point a Gui input Box will appear

   * Paste the Flight Info into this Text input
   * Press OK
   
It will be converted

   * a New Box will appear
     * Select the bits you want and paste into Ms-Word or Excel
